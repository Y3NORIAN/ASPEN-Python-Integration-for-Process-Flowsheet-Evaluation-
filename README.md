# ASPEN-Python-Integration-for-Process-Flowsheet-Evaluation-
This repository features an ASPEN-Python integration project I have worked on as part of the Chemical Engineering Summer Internship at the University of Manchester. The objective of this project is to explore how a Python script can be interconnected to ASPEN Plus to automate simulation tasks as well as overcome the limitations in extracting data via manual simulations in the development of intensified units such as chemical looping and reactive distillation. From a broader prospective, this project is motivated by the ambition to serve as a milestone in bridging the gap between programming and chemical engineering. In this repository, you will find 2 ASPEN Plus bkp files and their corresponding Python scripts. There is also a short report which details the methodology of developing these codes and their uses.
